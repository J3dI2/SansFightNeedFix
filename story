In the main game, Sans only fight when Frisk when he/she kill everyone.

In this case, Frisk or Chara reset 66 time, Sans started to become award of this event so he decide, no more liza time.
Frisk/Chara have no seen Sans when they left the ruin, not even in waterland or hotland.
They found Sans waiting for them in the middle of judgement hall, however, this is different.
Sans say how he meet 'G' and talk about all the timeline they have done and know what have to be done.
With that, Sans put up the idea of dogeing and go FULL ON OUT!!!!!!!!!! No mercy...

Sans is well award of what work and what didn't work as he also remember all the battle even if they go back to there save point.
In summery, all attack will be randomize and new, more dodge then he use to do, and try to use different soul effect(note:should be 
very weak for the fact he can only do blue soul).

People should be able to play it on computer, feeling of uneasyness,
